   - Download the latest version of Python (version 3.11 or whichever version your script requires).
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH."

2. **Install PyCharm (Optional):**
   - If you prefer using an integrated development environment (IDE), you can download and install PyCharm Community Edition from JetBrains: [Download PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

3. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `cmd` and press Enter to open the Command Prompt.

4. **Navigate to Script Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your Python script is located. For example:
     ```
     cd path\to\your\script\directory
     ```

5. **Install Requirements:**
   - If you haven't already installed the required Python packages, use pip to install them:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     Replace `requirements.txt` with the name of your requirements file if it's different.

6. **Run the Script:**
   - Once in the script directory, run your Python script using the following command:
     ```
     python main.py
     ```
     Replace `main.py` with the name of your main script file.
