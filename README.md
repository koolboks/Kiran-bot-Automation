# Kiran-bot-Automation

This is a student bot visa.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Download the Script

- Click on this link: [Kiran Bot Automation](https://github.com/koolboks/Kiran-bot-Automation/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download the script.
- Once downloaded, unzip the file. You'll find a folder named "Kiran-bot-Automation".

### Running the Script

1. Open the folder after unzipping it.
2. Go straight to `run_script.sh` and click it.
3. Take a coffee â˜• and relax because it will take longer time if you run for the first time.
4. After that, you can go to the [Telegram bot link for Student](https://t.me/BotFormFillerBot).

### Additional Notes

If you see 'Already Launched', please type in the bot message 'force'. This will reset the bot to ensure it runs separately and not in many coroutines.
